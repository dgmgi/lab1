	Hi! My name is Dave Angel but you can call me Dave.

	I love to stay indoors and occasionally go out with friends. <br>I love to play games, especially fighting games like Tekken and Marvel vs Capcom. I also love to read manga, watch anime,<br> and practice guitar to play anime OSTs.<br>

	I'm afraid of needles, especially when I'm going to have my blood extracted, or have a shot.<br> I usually get very sad, scared, and occasionally, cry before I get a needle in me ;-; <br>

	The most memorable moment for me was when I joined an official Tekken Tournament where I met professional players which are also my idols as they kept the community alive since before I was born. I didn't go last long in the tournament, but it was a fun experience.<br> Just like them, I want to make a significant mark on the community.

	I'm afraid of what will happen to me career-wise.<br> The pandemic has changed how I look at the future, but I'm still hoping that everything will all be good in the end.

	In the class, I expect to learn how to make an application look accessible.
